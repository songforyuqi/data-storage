                <h5>Compact Disc(CD)</h5>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Compact discs, also known as CDs, are laser-read optical discs. They were originally only used to store audio, but eventually the first CD-ROM(Compact Disc Read Only Memory) was invented in 1979, allowing audio and video storage. The standard CD-ROM, which is a thin, reflective circular storage disc, was created by Sony and Philips in 1985. A 120 mm CD could store up to 74 minutes of audio, and were placed inside CD players to play music. In 1996, the CD-RW(Compact Disc Rewritable) was created, allowing users to rewrite data to a CD-ROM. On its 25th anniversary in 1982, an estimate of 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide. Unfortunately, after the launch of online music streaming services like Apple Music in 2001 and Spotify and 2008, the popularity of CDs declined rapidly.</p>

                <h5>DVDs and HD-DVDs</h5>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;DVDs(Digital Versatile Discs) were brought over to the data storage industry from the film industry in 1995, and were designed to hold more data and more types of data than the CD. DVDs were optical discs used to carry high quality films, as opposed to CDs, which were mainly used for audio storage. DVDs were a quicker successor to CDs than CDs were to floppy disks, which shows the rapid increase in technological advancement in the last century. HD-DVDs, or High-Definition Digital Versatile Discs, were invented in 2006. HD-DVDs used a blue-violet laser, contrary to DVDs, which used red lasers. HD-DVDs were able to store 15GB, today a modern HD-DVD can store about 30GB. In 1996, the first DVD players were sold in Japan.</p>

                <h5>Blu-ray</h5>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Blu-ray was the successor to the DVD, and its competitor in the blue-violet laser industry. Blu-ray discs are of the optical storage type, and are used for the storage of high definition video and audio data. A single-layered Blu-ray disc can store 25GB of data, and a double layered Blu-ray disc can store up to 50GB. Blu-ray was created by the Blu-ray Disc Association, which was founded in February of 2002 by groups of people from the fields of electronics, computer science, and movies and films. During the early development of Blu-ray technology, the layer containing the data was very close to the surface of the disc. Due to this, early Blu-ray discs were extremely viable to scratches and surface damage, hence forcing them into a need for cartridges. Eventually, TDK, a Japanese electronics company, came up with a hard polymer coating for the discs, eliminating the need for cartridges. </p>
