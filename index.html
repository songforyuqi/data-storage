                <h5>Disk vs. Disc</h5>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;A common misconception is that disc and disk can be used interchangeably. Although people will probably know what youâ€™re talking about regardless of the term you use, there are key differences to be aware of when you use these terms. Disc and disk both refer to flat circular shapes, similar to plates and CDs, but disk is most commonly referred to as the American English spelling- whereas disc is referred to as the British English spelling. Disk is usually used to refer to computer components such as hard disks(also known as hard drives) and floppy disks. Disc is used to refer to sound carriers, such as CDs(compact discs) and vinyl discs. Disc is also used in the term DJ(disc jockey), because it refers to someone who spins discs that carry sound.</p>
