                <h5>Punch Cards</h5>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Originally created for use by looms, punch cards were invented in 1725 by Basile Bouchon. Later, punch cards were also used by Herman Hollerith to track population during the U.S. Census of 1890. Mostly made of cardstock paper and sometimes punched by hand, punch cards were read and interpreted through patterns of punched holes and blank spaces, making it a binary system that takes only two types of values. The punched holes represented sequences of instructions for a computer to perform, similar to textile looms and player pianos. Since one punch card could only store about 80 bytes of data, many cards were required for large scale data storage and programming. Today, punch cards are still used for specific purposes, like automatic parking systems.</p>

                <h5>Magnetic Tape</h5>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Today, a modern tape cartridge can store 15TB of data. THe first commercial magnetic tape storage system, created in 1952 by IBM, could store 1.1MB of data. The modern tape cartridge can store more than 13 million IBM models. Magnetic tape was invented in 1928 by Fritz Pfleumer, and was made out of a magnetic tape that could record both audio and video. Pfleumer bases the creation of the device on magnetic wire recording. IBM(International Business Machines) was one of the first companies to include magnetic tape in their commercially available computers.Even though magnetic tape isnâ€™t the fastest type of data storage, its offline capabilities make it a useful strategy even today. In 2011, a defective software update caused Google to accidentally lose saved emails from about 40,000 Gmail accounts. Even though Google has several copies of the data stored on hard drives across data centers located all around the country, they still lost the data. Google eventually recovered the lost emails from a magnetic tape backup. </p>

                <h5>Music Tape and Cassette Tapes</h5>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Invented in 1962 and brought to the market in 1963, the Philips company developed the music tape. Music tape is a type of magnetic tape, most commonly known in relation to cassette tapes. Music tape mainly became popular in 1979 with the invention of compact cassettes, and when PCs(Personal Computers) began using cassette tapes instead of floppy disks due to cost advantages. Before cassette tapes, music was largely vinyl based and not very portable. During the peak of cassette tape popularity, which was around the 1980s, more than 3 billion tapes were sold. The magnetic tape inside of cassette tapes had a lifespan of about 10-30 years, bringing to light the importance of digitization. Unfortunately for music tapes, popularity fizzled out to almost nonexistent by the early 2000s- and most mainstream companies had stopped production of cassette tapes by 2003.</p>
