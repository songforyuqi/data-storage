                <h5>CompactFlash</h5>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;In December of 1994, new company SunDisk(later rebranded as SanDisk to avoid confusion with Sun Microsystems) introduced to the market a new format of flash memory products that were small, used no power, and had no moving parts. CompactFlash is a portable storage device that is good for high capacity portable storage. It is a solid state device that uses flash memory, and consumes either 3 or 5 volts of power. Its main advantages are its portability, and the fact that it’s less susceptible to data corruption than HDDs due to its lack of moving parts. When it was first introduced, its first 4 capacities were 2MB, 4MB, 10MB, and 15MB. Today, CompactFlash technology is still used by many DSLR(Digital Single-Lens Reflex) cameras. </p>

                <h5>USB Flash Drive</h5>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;USB Flash Drives are small devices around 0.5 inch wide by 3 inches long that store data and are used for data transfer from one device to another. USB stands for Universal Serial Bus, and refers to the socket where a USB Flash Drive is plugged in to begin the data transfer. The initial model of USBs, USB 1.0, was released in 1995 by a group of technology companies including Intel, Compaq, Microsoft, and IBM. Their goal was to standardize the types of connectors to PCs and develop a basic device connection. 5 years later, in the year 2000, USB 2.0 was announced. It wasn’t widely available until 2003, but it had a significantly higher data transfer speed- about 30 times faster than USB 1.0(USB 1.0 could transfer 1MB/second, USB 2.0 could transfer 30MB/second).</p>
