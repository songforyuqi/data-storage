                <h5>Hard Disk Drives</h5>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;When the first hard drive, also known as an HDD(Hard Disk Drive) was created by IBM in 1956, the initial model could store 4.4MB of data. The first hard drive was patented in 1956. Made up of a central axis and rotating platters, a hard drive records and relays information on magnetic material(see <a href="cards-tapes.html#magnetic-tape">magnetic tape</a>). A hard drive consists of both read and write capabilities, and modern hard drives have max capacities of around 5TB. When they first came out, hard drives dominated the market for almost 30 years.Since the first hard drive, HDDs have adapted to meet many modern commercial needs such as making them smaller and more portable, along with storing much more data. Today, external hard drives are a corporate staple- they are one of the best hardware solutions to storing large amounts of backup data in a safe, external environment. While external hard drives may very well be replaced by cloud storage, hard drives have definitely come a long way.</p>

                <h5>Floppy Disks</h5>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp; The first models of floppy disks were 8 inches, and created in 1971. Floppy disks are circular pieces of magnetic film inside rectangular plastic sleeves. The measure of 8 inches is the diameter of the circular disk inside the plastic sleeve. The initial floppy disk model was read-only, meaning that data could not be modified once it was stored on the disk. An 8 inch floppy disk could store 1.2MB of data. Eventually in 1976, Shugart Associates introduced the 5.25 inch floppy disk as a “more convenient floppy disk”. It was almost the same as the 8 inch floppy disk, except for the size. IBM used the 5.25 inch floppy disk first in their Personal Computer in August of 1981, and by 1978, 5.25” floppy disks were produced by 12 companies. By the mid-1980s, floppy disks had read and write capabilities, and went through multiple improvements in the magnetic recording aspect.</p>
